Parameters:

--gpu-id value                  (gpu id/s from --list-devices, separate values with ; and !)
--gpu-intensity value           (gpu intensity, 1-31, separate values with ; and !)
--gpu-auto-intensity value	(0-disabled, 1-light, 2-normal, separate values with ; and !)
--gpu-raw-intensity value       (gpu raw intensity ( 1 << intensity ), separate values with ; and !)
--gpu-worksize value            (gpu worksize, separate values with ; and !)
--gpu-target-temperature value  (gpu temperature, separate values with ; and !)
--gpu-off-temperature value     (gpu turn off temperature, separate values with ; and !)
--gpu-target-fan-speed value    (gpu fan speed in RPM, separate values with !)
--gpu-adl-type value            (ADL to use (1-3), separate values with !)
--gpu-tweak-profile value       (number from 0-10, 0 disables tweaking)
--gpu-ethash-mode value         (1, 2 or 3. Default is 2, separate values with ; and !)
--gpu-cn-mode value		(0 or 1. Default is 0. If you have a weaker GPU try 1. separate values with ; and !)


On Linux you need to escape the ; character with a backslash! ( \; )
When setting any of the parameters don't use " or ' around the value!
Order of the parameters is important, always put --algorithm as the first parameter, and then use the gpu parameters!


Important:

If algorithm is using 2 threads per GPU (auto chosen or  manually set), there is a chance for memory leaking if intensity/raw-intensity value for the second thread is too high.
This can cause system crash, gpu crash or an unstable system!

--gpu-ethash-mode:
1 - No cache on GPU, so there is more space for DAG. Creation time is very slow, but it might extend mining time for a few epochs. Try with 4GB cards where DAG can't fit.
2 - Cache and DAG on GPU. This is the fastest mode. If using with 4GB cards where DAG can't fit, hashing will be very slow.
3 - No cache on GPU, so there is more space for DAG. You need to have at least one 8GB card in the same rig, and 5+ GB system RAM. Creation time is fast. Try with 4GB cards where DAG can't fit.
